## Product Management Framework - Overview
- A lightweight structure to keep thinking and execution aligned  
- Flexible across product maturity, team size, and business stage  
- Built from what’s worked (and failed) in real teams

---

### 1. Vision – Where we’re going

The long-term direction — the change we want to create in the world.

**Example (Microsoft):**  
*“Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.”*  
Not tied to specific products — it defines the company’s broader impact.

---

### 2. Mission – What we do and why

What we’re building and who it’s for. Helps the team focus and prioritize.

**Example (Shopify):**  
*“Make commerce better for everyone.”*  
Centered on independent merchants — and it shows in the product strategy.

---

### 3. Strategy – How we’ll win

How we compete, differentiate, or position ourselves.  
Good strategy is about clear trade-offs.

**Example (Apple):**  
*“Deliver tightly integrated hardware and software with a premium user experience.”*  
They win by saying no to flexibility — and doubling down on polish.

---

### 4. Roadmap – Turning strategy into bets

Breaks strategy into focused, time-bound bets.  
Each bet should be valuable even if it fails.

**Example (Meta):**  
*Q1 bet: Release Llama 3 with tools that make local deployment easier than using OpenAI’s API.*  
A clear move to win over open-source developers.

---

### 5. Hypotheses – What we’re testing in each bet

Every bet is based on assumptions. Make them explicit and testable.

**Example (Amazon):**  
*If we offer same-day delivery, customers will shop more often and with higher intent.*  
This drives Amazon’s push into last-mile logistics.

---

### 6. Success Criteria – What signals we expect

Define success using signals tied to behavior and outcomes — not vague goals.

**Example (Microsoft Teams):**  
*Weekly active usage grows faster in orgs under 100 people after launching simplified onboarding.*  
Not just “growth” — it’s tied to a specific bet and audience.

---

### 7. Resourcing – Who owns what and how we execute

Clarifies roles, ownership, and how the team works together.  
(R&R and Product Execution Framework)

**Example:**  
*PM defines the problem and success signals. Eng Lead scopes and delivers. Design owns flow and testing. Shared doc outlines how we make decisions and run rituals.*

This isn’t a checklist — it’s scaffolding. Adapt it to your team, your stage, and your context.
