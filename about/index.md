## About Me

I'm Konstantin — a product guy who’s spent the last decade building and scaling things at Microsoft and Yandex.

This site is a collection of notes, ideas, and frameworks — mostly around product thinking, systems, ML, and AI. It’s not a playbook. Just things worth writing down.

If you're into:
- Product management grounded in real-world execution  
- Applied machine learning and AI  
- Systems thinking and product strategy  
- Lessons learned through building, not theory  

…then you might find something here worth reading.
